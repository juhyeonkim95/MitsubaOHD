## Install
To compile, follow the original Mitsuba compliation guide at [here](https://github.com/mitsuba-renderer/mitsuba).

Instead of original config, please use double precision and mono-channel config (`config_double_single.py`).

## Parameter Explanation
New integrators are added in `src/integrators/fmcw` folder, for OHD rendering.
Two types of laser are typically used for OHD rendering, standard laser with constant frequency and swept-frequency laser with a chirp.
FMCW (frequency-modulated continuous-wave) use swept-frequency laser with up and down chirp.
Since FMCW is the most general case of OHD, we named integrator as `fmcw`.

### Integrator Types
* `fmcw_psd`: frequency-domain PSD (Power Spectral Density) rendering, corresponding to Algorithm1 in the paper. It outputs [H x W x 2M] where M is histogram bin number. 2M is for (up, down) chirp each.
* `fmcw_field`: time-domain rendering with field sampling and random phase addition, corresponding to Algorithm2 in the paper. It outputs [H x W x 4M] where M is FFT sample number. 4M is for (up, down) chirp x (real, complex) term each. 

### Detailed Parameters
* `wavelength` : Laser wavelength in nanometer (default : 1550)
* `f_0` : Laser frequency in GHz. If `wavelength` is also defined, we use `wavelength` first (default : 193,414)
* `T` : Sweep time for one chirp in microsecond (default : 10)
* `B` : Signal bandwidth in GHz (default : 1)
* `M` : Number of time stamps used for FFT or histogram bin (default : 4096)
* `use_collimated` : Ignore light setting and use collimated laser (default : false)
* `fov_error` : Additional parameter to change laser FOV. If set to $a$, instead of uniform sample from whole pixel, we sample centered square-area with $2a$ (default : 0.5).
* `use_random_phase` : Whether to use random phase addition for `fmcw_field`. (default : true)

## Usage
We included exhaustive examples in `ohd_tutorial` folder at [here](ohd_tutorial/README.md). 
You can simulate various experiments in the main paper including below interactive PSD visualization.
