# Mitsuba OHD Rendering Tutorial

===================================
## About
We provide several tutorials for OHD rendering.

### Speckle Simulation for Simple Case (in `tutorial_speckle_simple`)
This example provides a simple simulation on two peak case shown in Fig.7 in the main paper.
`main.py` does
* Evaluate normalized covariance matrix
* Evaluate power spectrum (to show Alg1 and Alg2 converge to the same result)
* Evaluate intensity histogram at specific frequency
